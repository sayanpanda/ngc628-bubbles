Bubble catalogs in NGC628

Provided are the three independent catalogs found by EJW (catalog A), KH (catalog B), and HK (catalog C) in the three folders listed as "catalog_A-main", "catalog_B", "catalog_C"

Main results are drawn using catalog A in Watkins et al 2023, and B and C are shown in the appendix to confirm the results remain similar with different catalogs found by different people.

All three tables have the same columns and units. First row lists the column names which are:
Column 1: ID -- Bubble ID
Column 2: RA_DMS -- RA in sexagesimal (dms)
Column 3: DEC_DMS -- Dec in sexagesimal (dms)
Column 4: SEMI_MAJ_PC -- Semi major axis (in parsec)
Column 5: SEMI_MIN_PC -- Semi minor axis (in parsec)
Column 6: AVG_RAD_PC -- Average radius (in parsec)
Column 7: PA_DEG -- Position angle in degrees (relative to the x axis. Anti clockwise is +ve, clockwise is -ve)
Column 8: ARM -- Which arm the bubble is closest to (note, we have not masked bubbles found within the galactic center, which we do in Watkins et al 2022)
Column 9: DIST_ARM_PC -- closest approach between the bubble center and an arm in parsec
Column 10: GAL_RAD_KPC -- Galactocentric distance in kiloparsec


Tables were updated on 02/05/2023 to correct the labeling of the RA and DEC units, which were labeled as hours, minutes, seconds, but the units are in degrees, minutes, seconds. No values were changed in this update. The only changes are the labels in Columns 2 and 3.
